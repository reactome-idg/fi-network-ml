The Python scripts in this folder are used for some NLP related work. The code here is based on two Python packages:

1. Flair: [https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/tree/master/flair](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/tree/master/flair)

2. BERTopic: [https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic)

3. Scanpy: [https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/)

4. leidenalg: pip3 install leidenalg
5. nbformat: for plotly related plot
6. plotly: pip install plotly==5.4.0

The Flair is used as the backend engine for document and work embeddings. The BERTTopic is used for clustering and visualization. Scanpy is used for umap-based visualization.

To work with these code, it is recommended to create a conda environment and have the above two Python packages installed first. 
The Python used for these code is 3.8.12 locally.
